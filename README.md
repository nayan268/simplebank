# Simple Bank


In this project, we learned step-by-step how to design, develop and deploy a backend web service from scratch. I believe the best way to learn programming is to build a real application. Therefore, throughout the project, we will learn how to build a backend web service for a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do the following things:

- Create and manage bank accounts.
- Record all balance changes to each of the accounts.
- Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts.

The programming language we used to develop the service is Golang, but the project is not just about coding in Go. We will learn a lot of different topics regarding backend web development. They are presented in 6 sections:

1. In the 1st section, we learned deeply about how to design the database, generate codes to talk to the DB in a consistent and reliable way using transactions, understand the DB isolation levels, and how to use it correctly in production. Besides the database, we also learned how to use docker for local development, how to use Git to manage our codes, and how to use GitHub Action to run unit tests automatically.

2. In the 2nd section, we learned how to build a set of RESTful HTTP APIs using Gin - one of the most popular Golang frameworks for building web services. This includes everything from loading app configs, mocking DB for more robust unit tests, handling errors, authenticating users, and securing the APIs with JWT and PASETO access tokens.  

3. In the 3rd section, we will learn how to build your app with Docker and deploy it to a production Kubernetes cluster on AWS. The lectures are very detailed with a step-by-step guide, from how to build a minimal docker image, set up a free-tier AWS account, create a production database, store and retrieve production secrets, create a Kubernetes cluster with EKS, use GitHub Action to automatically build and deploy the image to the EKS cluster, buy a domain name and route the traffics to the service, secure the connection with HTTPS and auto-renew TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt.

4. In the 4th section, we implemented several advanced backend topics such as managing user sessions, building gRPC APIs, using gRPC gateway to serve both gRPC and HTTP requests at the same time, embedding Swagger documentation as part of the backend service, partially updating a record using optional parameters, and writing structured logger HTTP middlewares and gRPC interceptors.

5. Then the 5th section we introduceced outselves to asynchronous processing in Golang using background workers and Redis as its message queue. We'll also learn how to create and send emails to users via Gmail SMTP server. Along the way, we learned more about writing unit tests for our gRPC services that might involve mocking multiple dependencies at once.

6. The final section 6th concludedes about how to improve the stability and security of the server. We'll keep updating dependency packages to the latest version, use Cookies to make the refresh token more secure, and learned how to gracefully shut down the server to protect the processing resources.



## Simple bank service

The service that we’re going to build is a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do following things:

1. Create and manage bank accounts, which are composed of owner’s name, balance, and currency.
2. Record all balance changes to each of the account. So every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account, an account entry record will be created.
3. Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts. This should happen within a transaction, so that either both accounts’ balance are updated successfully or none of them are.
